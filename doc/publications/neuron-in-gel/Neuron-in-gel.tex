\section{Introduction}

Excessive loading in facet capsule ligament (FCL) induces damage to the collagen network and axons of innervating neurons \textcolor{red}{[references]}. Although injurious ligament loading gives rise to pain, the local biomechanical mechanisms by which neurons are injured are still poorly understood. Recently, an integrated experimental and modeling approach was employed to examine the responses of neurons and the surrounding collagen fibers to ligamentous matrix loading. This approach provided initial understanding of how macroscopic deformation is translated to neuronal loading and signaling \cite{Zhang:2016ga}. In this paper, we build on the work of Zhang et al. \cite{Zhang:2016ga} and examine the local strains that arise in the neuron when it is deformed while embedded in a collagenous gel. In order to capture the physics of the fibrillar microstructure of the collagen gel a volume-averaged multi-scale model is employed \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp}. Although the multi-scale model has been previously used to model the passive mechanical contribution of cells in collagen gel, the embedded cell structure was represented with a simple spherical geometry \cite{Lai:2013fp}. In this paper we expand on the previous work by considering a realistic geometry of the neuron, which is reconstructed from experimental images. In order to accommodate the high computational demands required to incorporate the complex neuron geometry and the multi-scale nature of the surrounding collagen gel into our model, we employ the adaptive multi-scale simulation infrastructure (AMSI) \cite{Delalondre:2010kt} which is designed to simultaneously handle massively parallel simulations on multiple scales.

\section{Materials and Methods}
To mechanically model the neuron structure, a geometric model and its corresponding finite-element mesh is generated from confocal images of a neuron \blue{structure consisting of three connected neurons} from a neuronal culture that was developed to mimic innervation of collagenous tissue (see Ref.\ \citenum{Zhang:2016ga} for preparation of neuronal culture). Thereby, the complex geometry of the neuron is incorporated into the simulation and enables findings from the simulation to be extended to realistic physiological environments. The collagen gel that surrounds the neuron structure is modeled using a volume-average based multi-scale technique which has been employed for the same purpose in previous studies \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp,Barocas:2007gk,Lai:2012ji,Lake:2012jm}. The embedded neuron structure is modeled using a transversely isotropic constitutive relationship to capture the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the axon \cite{Peter:2012fc}. \blue{The parameters for both models were determined from experimental measurements}. An overview of the multi-scale method for the collagen gel and constitutive relationship for the neuron are discussed below.

%=========================================================================================================
\subsection{Generation of Model and Finite-Element Mesh from Experimental Images}
The complex geometry of a neuron is incorporated into the simulation by generating a geometric model of the neuron from experimentally measured confocal images. The confocal images were taken from a neuronal culture that was developed to mimic innervation of collagenous tissue. Briefly, dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons were embedded in three-dimensional collagen I gels. Immunocytochemistry was performed with an antibody against the cytoskeletal protein $\beta$III-tubulin (Abcam Cambridge, MA) to label for neuronal structure. Z-stack Images (2-micron thick) were taken by a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) using a 40X objective and with a resolution of 0.22 micron/pixel. The segmented stack of confocal images is shown schematically in Fig.\ \ref{fig:image_to_model}(a).

%

The confocal images were stacked together and converted to a 3D voxelated data set using \textit{ImageJ} \cite{Schneider:2012dw}, where each voxel has dimensions of 0.22$\mu$m $\times$ 0.22$\mu$m $\times$ 2$\mu$m. Voxel data corresponding to different regions of the neuron structure (i.e., axon and cell bodies) were labeled with unique values. Noise arising from the limited level of contrast in the imaging technique and quantization artifacts due to the voxel nature of the data were removed using a combination of erosion/dilation, manual reassignment, small object removal, and smoothing operations which were applied using the \textit{ImageToModel} tool \cite{Klaas:2013ug, Klaas_conference, simmetrix}. The processed voxelated data was converted to a discrete geometry using a procedure that is based on the marching cube algorithm \cite{Lorensen:1987vr}, which was also applied through the \textit{ImageToModel} tool. Subsequently, the discrete geometric model of the neuron structure was enclosed in a box that represents the domain of the collagen gel, where the neuron-gel interface is perfectly bonded. The mesh of the non-manifold geometry of the embedded neuron structure was generated using the SimModeler tool of Simmetrix Inc. \cite{simmetrix,Shephard:2000vc}. The neuron-in-gel model and its corresponding mesh are shown in Figs.\ \ref{fig:image_to_model}(b) and (c), respectively.

\subsection{Experimental Measurements}
\blue{The parameters for the multi-scale model of the collagen gel were chosen such that the experimental stress-strain curve is reproduced. These parameters are specified below when the formulation of the model is presented. With these parameters, the model also exhibits lateral contraction (Poisson ratio) and fiber-level alignment that are consistent with experimental measurements. An experimental stress-strain curve was measured from a rat tail collagen I gel, while fiber alignment data was measured from an innervated collagen gel (see Ref.\ \citenum{Zhang:2016ga} for preparation of the collagen and innervated collagen samples). }

To obtain the stress-strain responses experimentally, collagen I gels were subjected to uniaxial tensile loading at 0.5m/s to 8mm \blue{Picu suggests to specify strain value here instead} using an Instron 5865 (Instron, Norwood, MA), as described in Ref.\ \citenum{Zhang:2016ga}. The Instron Bluehill software collected the force and displacement data at 1kHz during loading. The stress and strain data were subsequently determined from the force and displacement data by dividing by the initial cross-sectional area and length, respectively, of the sample. The fiber alignment in innervated collagenous tissue was measured using the QPLI method \cite{Quinn:2008df,Quinn:2009bf} where alignment angle $\alpha$ and retardation $\delta$ is measured in each pixel. Our customized QPLI system is comprised of a fiber-optic light source (Dolan-Jenner Industries Inc., Boxborough, MA), a motor-controlled linear polarizer (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) that rotates at 750 rpm, and a circular analyzer mounted to a high-speed camera (Phantom-v9.1; Vision Research Inc, Wayne, NJ) \cite{Zhang:2016ga}. The QPLI system was integrated with the mechanical testing device, and collagen I gels were placed between the rotating polarizer and the circular analyzer. Polarized light images were acquired during tensile loading at 500 fps with 14.5 pixel/mm resolution and processed using harmonic analysis to extract the alignment angle and retardation \cite{Tower:2002hk,Quinn:2008df}.

%=========================================================================================================
\subsection{Multi-Scale Method for Modeling Collagen Gel}
Collagen gel has been modeled in the past using a multi-scale formulation based on volume averaging of fiber-network representative volume elements (RVEs) \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp,Barocas:2007gk,Lai:2012ji,Lake:2012jm} , which is also employed here to model the collagen gel that surrounds the neuron structure in our system. The multi-scale formulation consists of two scales: the microscopic scale that represents the fiber level and the macroscopic scale that represents the tissue level. Quantities corresponding to the microscopic and macroscopic scales are denoted with $(m)$ and $(M)$ superscripts, respectively.

The microscopic scale is represented by a collagen network, which defines the RVE. Each RVE is generated from a Delaunay triangulation of randomly placed seed points - the edges of the triangulation represent the fibers of the network. Each fiber only carries an axial load with the axial force given by: 
%
\begin{equation}
T_i^{(m)} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{E_f A_f}{B} \left[ \exp(0.5 B(\lambda_f^2 - 1)) - 1\right] & \text{if } \lambda_C \le \lambda_f \le \lambda_S \\
H_C  \lambda_f + h_C & \text{if } \lambda_f \ge \lambda_C \\
H_S \lambda_f + h_S & \text{if } \lambda_f \le \lambda_S
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fiber_force}
\end{equation}
%
where 
%
\begin{align*}
&E_f: \text{linear modulus of a collagen fiber.} \\
&A_f: \text{cross-sectional area of fiber.} \\
&B: \text{constant parameter that controls nonlinearity.} \\
&\lambda_f \equiv \frac{l}{l_0} \text{ where } l \text{ and } l_0 \text{ are the current and initial lengths, respectively, of the fiber. } \\
&\lambda_S: \text{ fiber stretch value at which the fiber relation transitions from nonlinear to linear.} \\
&\lambda_C: \text{ fiber compression value at which the fiber relationship transitions from nonlinear to linear.} \\
&H_i \equiv E_f A_f\lambda_i \exp(0.5B(\lambda_i^2 - 1)) \text{ for } i=S \text{ or } C.\nonumber\\
&h_i \equiv \frac{E_f A_f}{B}\left(\exp(0.5 B (\lambda_i^2-1)-1\right) -H_i \lambda_i \text{ for } i=S \text{ or } C. 
\end{align*}
%
The fiber force shown in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:fiber_force} transitions from a nonlinear to linear relationship when the fiber is stretched beyond $\lambda_S$ or compressed below $\lambda_C$. The transition to a linear fiber force relationship for large fiber stretch in tension is consistent with experimental measurements of single fibers \cite{Eppell:2006hh,Svensson:2010fr}. \blue{In principle, fibers do not carry load in compression. Since the fibers in this model only have axial forces, the stiffness in compression was chosen to be significantly smaller than that in tension to mimic buckling.} 

In order to solve for network equilibrium in the RVE, displacement boundary conditions are imposed. The displacements at the corners of the RVE are dictated by the deformation state of the macroscopic scale via
%
\begin{equation}
{}^c u^{(m)}_i = (F^{(M)}_{ij} - \delta_{ij}) \frac{{}^c x^{(m)}_j}{L^{(m)}},
\label{eq:downscaling}
\end{equation}
%
where $F^{(M)}_{ij}$ is the deformation gradient tensor of the macroscopic scale, ${}^c u^{(m)}$ are the displacements at the corners of the RVE,  and ${}^c x^{(m)}/L$ are the coordinates at the corners of the RVE. In Eq.\ \eqref{eq:downscaling}, ${}^c x^{(m)}_j$ are coordinates of a dimensionless \blue{computational domain that is a cube spanning the domain defined by (-0.5,0.5) in each of the three directions}. The scale conversion, $1/L^{(m)}$, relates the unit lengths between the \blue{computational} and physical domains. It is important to note that Eq.\ \eqref{eq:downscaling} is valid because the center of the RVE is \blue{defined} at the origin of the computational domain. The boundary displacements on each fiber lying on the boundary of the RVE are determined via  linear interpolation. This procedure of determining boundary displacements for the microscopic RVE from the macroscopic deformation state is referred to as \textit{downscaling}. 

Upon solving for \blue{network} equilibrium in each RVE, the Cauchy stress tensor of the macroscopic scale is computed from the forces of fibers that lie on the boundary of the RVE (bcl) \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp}
%
\begin{equation}
s_{ij}^{(m)} = \frac{1}{V^{(m)}} \sum_{\text{bcl}} x_i^{(m)} T_j^{(m)} ,
\label{eq:micro_stress_discrete}
\end{equation}
%
where $V^{(m)}$ is the current volume of the RVE and $s_{ij}^{(m)}$ are elements of the microscopic stress tensor. \blue{The microscopic stress tensor is transformed to the macroscopic stress tensor by rescaling by $L^{(m)}$. This procedure is needed due to the difference in length scales between the physical macroscopic domain and the non dimensional microscopic computational domain. The scaling between the macroscopic Cauchy stress tensor and $s_{ij}^{(m)}$ is }
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij}^{(M)} = s_{ij}^{(m)}\left(\frac{1}{L^{(m)}}\right)^2.
\label{eq:macro_stress_discrete}
\end{equation}
%
The procedure in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:macro_stress_discrete} is referred to as \textit{upscaling}. The Cauchy stress tensor obtained from the microscopic scale is used to solve the macroscopic force balance \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp}
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij,i}^{(M)} = \frac{1}{V^{(m)}} \int_{\partial V^{(m)}} \left( s_{ij}^{(m)} - \sigma_{ij}^{(M)} \right)u_{k,i}^{(m)} n_k dA^{(m)},
\label{eq:macro_stress_divergence}
\end{equation}
%
where $u_k^{(m)}$ is the displacement of the RVE boundary on the microscale and $n_k$ is the unit normal vector. The right-hand side of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:macro_stress_divergence} acts as a body force that accounts for the correlation between the inhomogeneous displacement of the RVE boundary and local inhomogeneities in the stress field \cite{Chandran:2007hy,Stylianopoulos:2007dp}. \blue{More explanation of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:macro_stress_divergence}}

\blue{The scaling parameter $L$ in Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:downscaling} and \eqref{eq:macro_stress_discrete} are required for both the downscaling and upscaling procedures.  The scaling factor $L$ between the computational and physical domains is determined by comparing the average fiber length in the RVEs to that in reconstituted collagen type I networks \cite{Lindstrom:2013gd} with collagen concentration of 2mg/mL. In the computational domain, fiber networks with a network density \blue{(total length of fibers/RVE volume)} of 100 ($\pm$ 1) and an average fiber length 0.26 are used for our RVEs. The average fiber length in reconstituted collagen type I networks is 1.81 $\mu$m \cite{Lindstrom:2013gd}. Based on these average lengths, $L=7 \ \mu$m.}

A good fit to the experimental stress-strain curve is obtained using the parameters of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:fiber_force} listed in Table \ref{table:fiber_parameters} for $L=7 \mu$m. The value of $A_f$ was chosen according to Ref.\ \citenum{Dutov:2016gu} where the fiber radius of rat tail collagen I was measured to be 162 \blue{nm}.

The Poisson ratio can be determined from the volume change of the domain via
%
\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{1}{2}\left(1- \frac{\Delta V}{V_0}\frac{l_0}{\Delta l}\right).
\label{eq:poisson-ratio}
\end{equation}
%
\blue{Equation \ref{eq:poisson-ratio} is a conventional measure of contraction that is derived from the usual definition of volumetric strain. Although Eq.\ \eqref{eq:poisson-ratio} is derived for small strain deformation, we conventionally extend the definition to the present case.} The Poisson ratio as a function of applied bulk strain for the fiber-force parameters listed in Table.\ \ref{table:fiber_parameters} is plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fiber_param2}(a). The Poisson ratio increases as a function of applied strain, and becomes larger than 0.5 at an applied strain of approximately $17\%$. The increasing Poisson ratio at larger applied strains is due to the presence of free volume in the network which allows significant geometric reorganization and fiber alignment \cite{Vader:2009js}. At lower strains, the increasing Poisson ratio is due to the nonlinear fiber-force relationship where the stiffness in tension is increasing (see stress-strain curve in Fig.\ \ref{fig:stress_strain}).

%

Fiber alignment is measured using the orientation index $P_2$. The value of $P_2$ is calculated from the angle $\theta$ between fibers and the direction of alignment
%
\begin{equation}
P_2 = \frac{3 <\cos^2\theta> - 1}{2},
\label{eq:P2_simulation}
\end{equation}
%
where $<x>$ denotes the average of $x$. The value of $P_2$ ranges from 1 ($\theta=0$ or $\pi$) in which the fibers are completely aligned to -1/2 ($\theta=\pi/2$) in which the fibers are orthogonal to the alignment direction. When $P_2=0$, the fiber network is randomly oriented. The orientation index $P_2$ can be calculated from $\alpha$ and $\delta$ of the QPLI method via (see Appendix A for derivation)
%
\begin{align}
&P_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(3 \int_0^{\pi} p(\theta) \cos^2\theta d\theta - 1\right) \nonumber\\
&p(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \frac{1-2\delta_i}{\pi} + \frac{4 \delta_i}{\pi}\cos^2(\theta - \alpha_i)\right],
\label{eq:P2_experiment}
\end{align}
%
where $\delta_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are the retardation and alignment angle, respectively, of the $i^{th}$ pixel. The fiber alignment as a function of bulk applied strain calculated from simulation and measured experimentally are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fiber_param2}(b). \textcolor{red}{[How to explain discrepancy in alignment between simulation and experiments?]}

%\textcolor{red}{[According to Professor Picu, alignment is more pronounced at low strains and less pronounced at high strains if deformation is non-affine (compared to the case of affine deformation). The behavior in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fiber_param2}(b) is in agreement if it is valid that the Delaunay fiber network that we are using deforms affinely due to the the large coordinate of the Delaunay network used in our model.]}

\subsection{Constitutive Relationship for Modeling of Neurons}
Cross-linked microtubule bundles that are axially aligned are a major structural feature of axons and give rise to macroscopic anisotropic mechanical behavior \cite{Peter:2012fc}. To account for such mechanical anisotropy, the axons are modeled as a transversely isotropic hyperelastic material \cite{JavierBonet:2008uxa,Bonet:1998vc}. The elements of the Cauchy stress tensor and spatial elasticity tensor can be expressed in terms of neo-Hookean (nh) and transversely isotropic (trns) components \cite{Bonet:1998vc}
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij} = \sigma^{\text{nh}}_{ij} + \sigma^{\text{trns}}_{ij} \ \ \text{ and } \ \ c_{ijkl} = c^{\text{nh}}_{ijkl} + c^{\text{trns}}_{ijkl},
\end{equation}
%
respectively, where 
%
\begin{align}
&\sigma^{\text{nh}}_{ij} = \frac{\mu}{J}(b_{ij} - \delta_{ij}) + \lambda(J-1)\delta_{ij} \nonumber\\
%
&\sigma^{\text{trns}}_{ij} = \frac{2\beta}{J}(a_r a_r - 1)\delta_{ij} + \frac{2}{J}[\alpha+2\beta\ln J+2\gamma(a_r a_r -1)]a_i a_j - \frac{\alpha}{J}(b_{is}a_s a_j+a_i b_{jr}a_r) \nonumber\\
%
&c^{\text{nh}}_{ijkl} = \lambda(2J-1)\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + \frac{2}{J}[\mu - \lambda J(2J-1)]\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} \nonumber\\
%
&c^{\text{trns}}_{ijkl} = \frac{8\gamma}{J}a_i a_j a_k a_l + \frac{4\beta}{J}(a_i a_j \delta_{kl} + \delta_{ij}a_k a_l) - \frac{\alpha}{J}(a_i a_l b_{jk} + b_{ik}a_j a_l) - \frac{4\beta}{J}(a_r a_r - 1)\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}.
\label{eq:trns_iso}
\end{align}
%
\blue{In Eq.\ \eqref{eq:trns_iso}, $b_{ij}$ are elements of the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor and $a_i$ is a component of the direction of anisotropy in the deformed state.} The constants of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:trns_iso} are defined as
%
\begin{align}
&\lambda = \frac{2\mu (\nu+n\nu^2)}{m} \ \ \ \ \ \gamma = \frac{E_A(1-\nu)}{8m} - \frac{\lambda+2\mu}{8} + \frac{\alpha}{2} - \beta \nonumber\\
%
&\alpha = \mu - G_A \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ m = 1 - \nu - 2 n\nu^2 \nonumber\\
%
&\beta = \frac{\mu \nu^2(1-n)}{2m} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n = \frac{E_A}{2\mu(1+\nu)},
\label{eq:trns_iso_constants}
\end{align}
%
where $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $G_A$ is the axial shear modulus, $\nu$ is the Poisson ratio, and $E_A$ is axial Young's modulus. In our analysis, the shear modulus is set to be isotropic such that $G_A=\mu$ and $\alpha = 0$. All the constants in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:trns_iso_constants} are set once $\mu$, $G_A$, $\nu$, and $E_A$ are specified.

The value of $E_A$ is based on the study by Peter and Mofrad \cite{Peter:2012fc}, where the mechanical behavior of axonal microtubule bundles under tension were simulated with a discrete bead-spring model. To apply their results for microtubule bundles to our neuron model, we assume that only the microtubule bundles carry force in the axon and that the stress of the microtubule bundles can be redistributed over the cross-sectional area of the axon. Since the microtubules are the stiffest component of the cytoskeleton \cite{Fletcher:2010ku}, the mechanical contribution from the actin filaments (membrane cortex) is ignored. Based on these assumptions, the axial stiffness of the axon can be related to the axial stiffness of the microtubule bundles, $E_{MTb}$, by
%
\begin{equation}
E_A = \frac{E_{MTb} A_{MTb}}{A_A},
\label{eq:EA_EMTb_relation}
\end{equation}

where $A_{MTb}$ and $A_A$ are the cross-sectional areas of the microtubule bundle and axon, respectively. Peter and Mofrad \cite{Peter:2012fc} suggested that the stress-strain relationship of the microtubule bundle is well represented by a power-law fit which results in an elastic modulus that is a function of strain. For this study, $E_{MTb}$ was taken to be an average value of $4\times 10^{4}$ kPa. \blue{The value of $A_{MTb}$ was determined to be 0.344 $\mu$m${}^2$ from the hexagonal bundle geometry of the microtubules (see Ref.\ \citenum{Peter:2012fc} for schematic). The cross-section of the hexagonal bundle contains 19 rows of microtubules with a center-to-center microtubule spacing of 45nm. Each  individual microtubule has a diameter of 25nm. The value of $A_A$ was determined to be 19.6 $\mu$m${}^2$ based an average axon diameter of 5 $\mu$m in the neuron structure.} Based on the above values, $E_A$ is determined from Eq.\ \eqref{eq:EA_EMTb_relation} to be 70 kPa.

In Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA} $D$ is the distance of an interior point of the cell body to the closest cell-body/axon interface and $t$ is a constant that dictates how quickly $E_A$ decreases when moving from the cell-body/axon interface towards the interior of the cell body. The axial stiffness decreases more quickly for smaller values of $t$.  \blue{According to Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA}, $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ depends on $D$, which is the nearest distance from the cell-body/axon interface. As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:image_to_model}(b), the largest cell body in the neuron has an axial length of approximately 51 $\mu$m, which gives $D = 25.5 \ \mu$m.

\section{Implementation}
Our model is implemented using the adaptive multi-scale simulation infrastructure (AMSI) \textcolor{red}{[reference for AMSI?]}, which is designed to simultaneously handle massively parallel simulations on multiple scales. AMSI enables our model to accommodate the high computational demands of solving the mechanical equilibrium equations on the complex geometry of the neuron structure and for the multi-scale problem in the collagen gel. The implementation details are provided below. The choices of modeling parameters in the multi-scale method for the collagen gel and in the constitutive relationship for the neuron are also discussed below.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}

\blue{The embedded neuron model described above provides local strain information within the neuron structure that is inaccessible by current experimental measurements. Such strain information can be used to examine the threshold for neuron injury, which provides physiological insights about the cause of pain when an innervated ligament is excessively loaded.} \textcolor{red}{[How representative is this one neuron configuration that we study? Can we extrapolate these results to other studies?]} 

For this study, the collagen gel surrounding the neuron structure is subjected to far-field (bulk) strains of up to 16$\%$, which corresponds to painful ligament loading \cite{Zhang:2016ga}. The strain within the neuron structure is quantified by a complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) defined as 
%
\begin{equation}
\text{ccdf}(X) = \int_{X}^{\infty} p_{\epsilon^*}(X)d\epsilon^* = \text{Pr}[ \epsilon^*\le X],
\label{eq:ccdf}
\end{equation}
%
\blue{where $p_{\epsilon^*}(X)$ is the probability density function of $\epsilon^*$ and $\epsilon^*$ is either the maximum principal strain (MPS) normalized by the applied bulk strain on the surrounding gel ($\epsilon_{\text{max}}/\epsilon_{\text{bulk}}$) or the MPS itself ($\epsilon_{\text{max}}$). When $\epsilon^* = \epsilon_{\text{max}}/\epsilon_{\text{bulk}}$, the applied bulk strain on the surrounding gel is amplified in the neuron structure when $\epsilon^* > 1$. When the local-strain amplification is large, moderate loads that are applied to the surrounding gel can give rise to injury in the neuron.} Equation \ref{eq:ccdf} is the probability that the neuron structure (equivalent to the volume fraction of the neuron) experiences a local-strain amplification ($\epsilon^* = \epsilon_{\text{max}}/\epsilon_{\text{bulk}}$) or local-strain ($\epsilon^* = \epsilon_{\text{max}}$) of \textit{at least} $X$. 

%=========================================================================================================
\subsection{Strain Distribution}
In this section, the MPS of the embedded neuron structure is examined. For this analysis, the surrounding gel is loaded parallel to the 0 degree axis indicated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:analysis_schematic} and the axial stiffness in the cell body, $E_A^{\text{cell}}$, is set by Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA} with $t=30$.

For both non painful and painful ligament loading, large portions of the neuron experience strains that are greater than the applied bulk strain on the surrounding gel. This indicates that the applied strains on the collagen gel are amplified in the neuron structure, which can lead to neuronal damage even when the surrounding tissue is moderately loaded. 

To gain a more quantitative understanding of the local-strain amplification in the neuron, ccdfs of the MPS in the neuron structure are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_ccdf_0deg_mps} for 10$\%$ and 16$\%$ bulk strains in the collagen gel.

\subsection{Effect of Changing the Axial Stiffness in the Cell Body}
\label{sec:cellbody_stiffness}
\blue{The transition in the axial stiffness of the cell bodies presented in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA} is artificial. To understand how this transition affects the final strain distribution in the neuron structure, the transition rate is varied by adjusting $t$ in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA}. As seen from Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA}, the value of $t$ needs to be greater than $D$ (=25.5 $\mu$m) in order for $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ to be positive. Consequently, three values of $t$ are considered: $t=$ 28 $\mu$m, 30 $\mu$m, and 50 $\mu$m, which correspond to axial stiffnesses of approximately 6.25 kPa, 10.5 kPa, and 34.3 kPa, respectively, at the center of the largest cell body in the neuron structure.} The ccdfs for different axial stiffnesses of the cell body (different values of $t$) are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_ccdf_vary_a} for the 0 degree loading case at an applied bulk strain of 16$\%$ in the collagen gel.

The averages are indicated with black dashed-dotted lines. }
\end{figure}
%

As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_ccdf_vary_a}, the volume fraction of the neuron that experiences a MPS of less than \blue{the applied bulk strain (16$\%$)} remains constant for all values of $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ considered. On the other hand, the volume fraction of the neuron that experiences a \blue{MPS of greater than the applied bulk strain} decreases only slightly as $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ increases. On average, the MPS for all values of $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ considered is greater \blue{than the applied bulk strain, with approximately $1\%$ of the neuron structure experiencing local-strain amplification of more than twice the applied bulk strain}. The small effect that changing $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ has on the overall strain distribution of the neuron suggests that the local-strain amplification experienced in the embedded neuron structure is not due to variations in its material properties. \blue{Therefore, the effect of neuron-structure configuration  relative to loading direction on the strain distribution is explored in the next section.}

%=========================================================================================================
\subsection{Effect of Changing the Loading Direction}
\label{sec:loading_direction}
In this section, we examine how the strain distribution of the neuron structure changes when the loading direction on the collagen gel is varied. The structural features in the neuron are exposed to different modes of deformation when the loading direction is adjusted. Through this analysis, we \blue{will develop} insights about how the geometric configuration of the neuron structure can give rise to local-strain amplification.

The three different loading cases considered in this section are shown schematically in Fig.\ \ref{fig:analysis_schematic}(a). The effect of changing the loading angle is explored for $E_A^{\text{cell}}$ corresponding to $t$=30 in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cellEA}. Color maps of the MPS on the neuron structure for loading angles of 45 and 90 degrees are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_MPS} for bulk strains of 10$\%$ and 16$\%$ in the collagen gel.

As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_MPS} and comparing to the 0 degree loading case in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_0deg_MPS}, the strain distribution in the neuron structure varies significantly for different loading angles. In all scenarios, large portions of the neuron experience strains that are greater than the applied bulk strain in the collagen gel. The variation in strain distribution above can be quantitatively captured in ccdfs of the MPS in the neuron structure, which are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_ccdf_mps} for loading angles of 45 and 90 degrees at bulk strains of 10$\%$ and 16$\%$.

Consistent with what is observed in the strain distribution when comparing the color maps of Figs.\ \ref{fig:neuron_0deg_MPS} and \ref{fig:neuron_MPS}, the ccdfs vary significantly for different loading directions. 

\blue{For both non painful and painful ligament loading at 45 and 90 degrees, the average MPS in the neuron structure is greater than the applied bulk strain on the surrounding gel.

\blue{From Table \ref{table:ccdf_volfrac_compare}, the volume fraction of the neuron structure that experiences a local-strain amplification of more than two times when loaded at 45 and 90 degrees is significantly larger than in the 0 degree loading case.}

\blue{Although the average strain amplification in the neuron structure is greater when loaded at 45 degrees than when loaded at 0 degrees, the tail of the strain distribution for the 45 degree case is shorter with a maximum strain amplification that is less than three times. In the 90 degree loading case, the average strain amplification is nearly double for non painful loading and more than double for painful loading. The tail of the distribution is significantly longer with 9.7$\%$ and 15$\%$ of the neuron structure experiencing strain amplifications of three times for non painful and painful ligament loading, respectively.}

%Variation in the shape and spread of the neuron strain distributions at different bulk strains is greatest in the case of 90 degree loading, where the spread of the distributions increase with larger bulk strain. In contrast, the variations in shape and spread of the neuron strain distributions are small for the 0 and 45 degree loading cases. Additional insight can be gained by separating the neuron strain distribution into contributions from the cell bodies and axons. The distributions of maximum principal strain in the cell bodies and axons are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:rgns_ccdf_mps}.

%The separate distributions for the cell bodies and axons provide additional details about the variations in shape and spread of the neuron distributions in Fig.\ \ref{fig:neuron_ccdf_mps}. For the 0 degree loading case, variations in the distribution at different bulk strains become more apparent. For the cell bodies, the distribution shifts to the right for larger bulk strains indicating that the amplification in the local strain becomes larger with more deformation in the surrounding gel. On the contrary, the middle portion of the axon distribution shifts to the left with increasing bulk strains indicating that the local strain amplification decreases with more deformation in the surrounding gel. The response in the cell bodies and axons cancel out resulting in only slight variations in the overall neuron strain distribution. 
%
%For the 45 degree loading case, variations only arise in the axon distribution. Therefore, the variations seen in the overall neuron distribution is solely due to variations in the axon. Similar to the 0 degree loading case, the axon distribution for the 45 degree loading shifts to the left with larger bulk strains indicating a decrease in the local strain amplification as the surrounding gel is increasingly deformed.
%
%For the 90 degree loading case, large variations are seen in both the cell body and axon distributions. For the cell bodies, the subtle step feature seen in the overall neuron distribution becomes more apparent. This step feature corresponds to two regimes of strain which are clearly seen in the over plot of maximum principal strain on the neuron in Figs.\ \ref{fig:neuron_MPS}(e) and (f). For both the cell body and axon, the distributions shift to the right with increasing bulk strains indicating that the local strain amplification increases with increasing deformation in the surrounding gel. 
%
%The results above indicate that the local strains experienced by the neuron is significantly larger than the applied load on the surrounding gel. The extent of local strain amplification depends on the configuration of the neuron relative to the loading angle. To clarify the cause of local strain amplification in the neuron, the axial strains along a region of the neuron structure are examined.
%
%%=========================================================================================================
%\subsection{Axial Strain Distributions}
%In this section we examine the axial strains, which are more directly linked to the actual geometry of the neuron structure, to shed light on the relationship between local strain amplification and the relative configuration of the neuron with respect to loading angle. Our analysis focuses on a portion of the neuron structure that lies along a single axis. This portion of the neuron is highlighted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_schematic} where the axes on which the strain distributions are calculated are also specified (i.e., axis 1 and axis 2).

%
%Distributions of the axial strains along axes 1 and 2 are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_distr} for different loading angles. Depending on the loading angle, axes 1 and 2 will experience either tensile or compressive axial strains. In the case of tensile strains, the ccdf in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:ccdf} is used, while the cdf in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:cdf} is applied for compressive strains. For the 0 degree loading case the axial strains along axis 1 are tensile while those along axis 2 are compressive. The opposite is true for the 90 degree loading case - compressive strain in axis 1 and tensile strain in axis 2 - because the load direction is orthogonal. In the case of 45 degree loading, axis 1 experiences tensile strains while axis 2 experiences mostly compressive strains with a small fraction of the structure experiencing tensile strains.

%As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_distr}, variations in the strain distributions are greatest for the 90 degree loading case where the amplification of local axial strain increases with increasing bulk strain - the distributions shift left and right for compressive and tensile strains, respectively. In contrast, only small variations are seen in the strain distributions for the 0 and 45 degree loading cases.

%From a physiological stand point, the largest strains (i.e., the tails of the distributions) are most important because those are the regions where neuron damage arises. To understand how the high strain portions of the neuron structure relate to bulk strain applied to the gel, the local-strain amplification corresponding to the portion of the structure that experiences the largest 5$\%$ strain (0.05 on ordinate of distributions in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_distr}) are plotted as a function of bulk strain in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_amp}.

%As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:axial_amp}, the local-strain amplification of the lateral compressive strains increase for all loading angles - axis 2 for 0 and 45 degree loading and axis 1 for 90 degree loading. This is consistent with the fact that the Poisson ratio of the collagen gel increases with larger deformations (see Poisson ratio curve in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fiber_param2}(a)). Note that for 45 degree loading, axis 2 experiences tensile strains at smaller bulk strains before the lateral compressive strains that arise from the Poisson ratio effect become large enough to dominate. Interestingly, the local-strain amplification of the tensile strain decreases for the 0 and 45 degree loading cases and increases for the 90 degree loading cases - axis 1 for 0 and 45 degree loading and axis 2 for 90 degree loading. This result suggests that a configuration where the axial direction of the neuron is near parallel to the loading direction (e.g., axis 1 for 0 and 45 degree loading cases) is more favorable than a configuration where the axial direction of the neuron is near orthogonal to the loading direction (e.g., axis 2 for the 90 degree loading case). The underlying mechanisms for such behavior is explored in the next section.

\section{Discussion}

The results in Sections \ref{sec:cellbody_stiffness} and \ref{sec:loading_direction} illustrate that the strain distribution (ccdf) in the neuron structure, and hence strain amplification, is most strongly influenced by the configuration of the neuron with respect to the loading direction. The strong dependence of the strain distribution on loading configuration reflects the anisotropic nature of the embedded neuron structure, where the axial stiffness is one order of magnitude stiffer than the transverse stiffness. Relative to the stiffness of the surrounding collagen gel, the axial stiffness of the neuron is larger while the transverse stiffness of the neuron is smaller. Due to the complex geometry of the embedded neuron structure studied above, the neuron structure is exposed to both transverse and axial components of loading. The spread of ccdfs reflects the range of tranverse and axial loads that different regions within the neuron structure is exposed to.

Some insight about the magnitude of the strain amplification for transverse and axial loading can be gained by simplifying the embedded neuron structure system into a one-dimensional gel-neuron-gel series. For such a system, the strain in the neuron can be expressed in terms of the strain in the gel by
%
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\text{neuron}} = \frac{K_{\text{gel}}}{K_{\text{neuron}}}\epsilon_{\text{gel}},
\label{eq:series_analysis}
\end{equation}
%
where $K_{\text{gel}}$ and $K_{\text{neuron}}$ are the stiffnesses in the gel and neuron, respectively. The ratio of gel stiffness to neuron stiffness represents the strain amplification in the neuron structure. The simplified series configuration represents an upper bound for the strain amplification experienced in the neuron structure. Using Eq.\ \ref{eq:series_analysis}, the upper bounds of the two extremes of pure transverse and axial loading can be examined. 

At one extreme when the load on the neuron structure is purely transverse, $K_{\text{neuron}} = 1.5$ kPa and is less than $K_{\text{gel}}$. Since $K_{\text{neuron}} < K_{\text{gel}}$, strain amplification in the neuron structure arises. The strain amplification becomes larger with deformation because the $K_{\text{gel}}$ increases due to stiffening during deformation. From Eq.\ \eqref{eq:series_analysis}, the strain amplification for non painful and painful loading is \red{15 and 30} times, respectively.

At the other extreme when the load on the neuron structure is purely axial, $K_{\text{neuron}} = 70$ kPa and is greater than $K_{\text{gel}}$. Since $K_{\text{neuron}} > K_{\text{gel}}$, the strain experienced by the neuron structure is less than that in the gel. The strain discrepancy between the neuron structure and gel decreases with deformation due to the stiffening of the collagen gel. From Eq.\ \eqref{eq:series_analysis}, the strain amplification for non painful and painful loading is \red{0.3 and 0.7} times, respectively.

The upper bound scenarios described above can be applied to understand the simulation results for the embedded neuron structure. In all cases of non painful and painful ligament loading considered, the average strain amplification is greater than one. This suggests that on average more of the neuron structure is exposed to transverse loading than axial loading in all cases. As the loading angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees, the volume fraction of neuron structure that is exposed to transverse loading increases as reflected by the increasing average strain amplification.

As mentioned above, the spread in the strain distributions reflect the complex geometry of the neuron structure. Of the three loading angles considered, the neuron structure is loaded most uniformly when the gel is loaded at 45 degrees as reflected by the relatively narrow spread of its strain distribution. The wider spread in the strain distributions for 0 and 90 degree loading is due to the existence of neurons in the structure that lie nearly parallel to the 0 degree and 90 degree axis. As a result, when the gel is loaded at either 0 or 90 degrees, the neuron structure will be exposed to both nearly pure transverse and axial loadings. 

Physiologically most important is the right tail of the distributions, which corresponds to the maximum strain experienced in the neuron structure. Of the cases considered, the largest strain amplification in the neuron structure is observed when the gel is loaded at 90 degrees. As seen in Table \ref{table:ccdf_volfrac_compare}, 9.7$\%$ and 14$\%$ of the neuron structure experiences a strain amplification of three times or more for non painful and painful ligament loading, respectively, along the 90 degree axis. For the 0 degree loading case, less than 1$\%$ of the neuron structure experiences strain amplification beyond two times for non painful ligament loading. When the deformation reaches painful loading at 0 degrees, the volume fraction of the neurons structure experiencing at least two times strain amplification increases to 3.2$\%$. For the 45 degree loading case, 8.4$\%$ and 7$\%$ of the neuron structure experiences a strain amplification of two times.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we investigated the mechanical response of a neuron that is deformed while embedded in a collagen gel. The following are the main findings of this work

\begin{enumerate}
\item The deformation state of the neuron varies significantly for different loading configurations on the surrounding collagen gel (Section \ref{sec:loading_direction}). In contrast, the deformation state varies much less significantly when the material properties in the neuron were varied (Section \ref{sec:cellbody_stiffness}).
\item For all loading conditions considered, the maximum MPS experienced in the neuron is 3 to 6 times larger than the applied (bulk) strain in the surrounding collagen gel.
\item Local-strain amplification is greatest when the neuron is exposed to deformation in the transverse direction because the transverse stiffness of the neuron is smaller than the gel stiffness. The local-strain amplification becomes larger with more deformation due the collagen gel becoming stiffer. In contrast, the strain experienced in the neuron is less than that in the collagen gel when the neuron is exposed to deformation in the axial direction because the axial stiffness of the neuron is greater than the gel stiffness. 
\item The local-strain amplification in the neuron is greatest for the 90 degree loading case in which most of the neuron is being loaded in the transverse direction. The local-strain amplification becomes larger with larger applied loading to the collagen gel, which reflects the stiffening of the collagen gel as it becomes more deformed.
\item The local-strain amplification in the neuron is smaller in the 0 and 45 degree loading cases in which axial loading is more prominent. The spread in the ccdf for the 0 degree loading case is wider indicating a less uniform loading on the neuron structure. Additionally, the tail of the ccdf for 0 degree loading is longer indicating a larger local-strain amplification in the 0 degree case than in the 45 degree case.
\item The neuron exhibits ``self correcting" behavior in the 0 degree loading case where the tail of the ccdf becomes shorter with increased deformation to the surrounding collagen gel. The ``self correcting" mechanism is due to the alignment of the neuron axis along the direction of loading during deformation. The shortening of the tail in the ccdf indicates that the axial alignment of the neuron structure takes place more rapidly than the stiffening of the collagen gel.

\section*{Appendix A: Derivation of $P_2$ from $\alpha$ and $\delta$ of the QPLI method}
\label{app:P2_derivation}

Consider a distribution of orientation $\theta$ described by 
%
\begin{equation}
p(\theta) = q_1 + q_2\cos^2(\theta - \alpha) \ \ \text{for} \ \ \alpha \in (0,\pi),
\label{eq:distribution}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ is the alignment measured at each pixel by the QPLI method and $q_1$ and $q_2$ are constants. Applying the normalization 
%
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\pi}p(\theta)d\theta = 1,
\end{equation}
%
a relationship between $q_1$ and $q_2$ is obtained:
%
\begin{equation}
\pi q_1 + \frac{\pi}{2}q_2 = 1.
\label{eq:q_relationship}
\end{equation}
%
Using the relationship in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:q_relationship}, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:distribution} can be rewritten as
%
\begin{equation}
p(\theta) = q + \frac{2}{\pi}(1-\pi q)\cos^2(\theta-\alpha)
\label{eq:distribution_q}
\end{equation}
%

The orientation tensor can be written in terms of $p(\theta)$ as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\pmb{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\int_0^{\pi} p(\theta) \cos^2(\theta)d\theta & \int_0^{\pi} p(\theta) \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)d\theta \\
\int_0^{\pi} p(\theta) \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)d\theta & \int_0^{\pi} p(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)d\theta
\end{bmatrix} = 
%
\frac{1-\pi q}{4} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(2 \alpha) & \sin(2 \alpha) \\
\sin(2\alpha) & - \cos(2\alpha)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}
%

  - Support for boundary conditions

The software allows for specification of prescribed displacement boundary conditions on geometric model entities. These displacements may either be specified independently for each component of the displacement vector, and may be specified as a function of the simulation time $t$ or as a static value.  Support for expressions in terms of the global coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ is also possible, but due to the implementation of the geometry and meshing database supporting the software it may not be expressed in terms of $(x,y,z,t)$. For our purposes being restricted to only expressions in terms of $t$ has not proved limiting thus far, but may prove a limitation for contact problems (though they would likely involve the implementation of a seperate method of specifying prescribed displacements in any event). 

Force boundary conditions may also be specified using the geometric model fairly generally, though again with the same restriction on specifying them either in terms of $t$ or $(x,y,z)$ but not both simultaneously.

Both types of boundary conditions are specified using the simmodeler program provided by Simmetrix software, which also produces the geometry and meshing systems our simulation uses. Specifying them using this program prevents the software from requiring recompilation for every problem with a different set of boundary conditions.

  - load stepping # load steps
  - fixed delta-t newton solver # iterations
  - supported geometry/mesh

At present any geometry supported by both the Parasolid modeling kernel (and related geometric file format) and the Simmetrix SimModel geometric library can be used in the simulation. Only linear tetrahedral meshes generated on these geometries have been used at present, though the microscale and macroscale simulations have untested support for general linear elements, the multiscale communication component currently does not provide the level of support we would prefer for more general element/mesh types (as the multiscale communication is in part dependent on the element type), but can provide support with minimal changes for any element type and already supports any number of numerical integration points potentially hosting microscale RVE simulations.
